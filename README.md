# GitHub for Organizing Research

## Rationale
We are using Github to track project progress, items we need to finish and discuss, and to give structure to our meetings. This approach is similar in nature to using Trello with a Kanban board configuration. We use this over Trello because of our success with using GitHub in our code and controls development and to minimize the number of different tools we have going.

## Implementation Overview

### Issues

We have two types of issues: `todo` issues and `roadmap` issues. We set up the repositories to be pre-loaded with templates for each of these issues.

`todo` issues: 
- one GitHub issue == one `todo` item
- The template prompts the user to provide information in the following fields: `Abstract`, `Context`, and `Approach`. This is optional, but encouraged.
- A best practice is to make these issues small enough in scope that they can be reasonably completed within one week. If it takes longer than that, it probably is actually a collection of to-do items, and should be broken up into a series of smaller `todo` items. This is generally done by listing all of the smaller items as a checklist of issues under the `Approach` heading
- When you need to quickly record that something needs to get done, but donâ€™t have time to properly articulate the issue: get that issue created with a partial description. **And then, later, come back and explain it.**
